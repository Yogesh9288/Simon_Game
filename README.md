# Simon Game 
The Simon Game is a fun and interactive memory-based game where players are challenged to repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds. Inspired by the classic electronic game, this web-based version allows players to test and improve their memory and concentration skills.

How to Play
Press the Start button to begin the game.
Watch and listen as the game displays a sequence of colors with corresponding sounds.
Repeat the sequence by clicking on the color buttons in the correct order.
With each correct attempt, the sequence grows longer, increasing the difficulty.
Make a mistake, and it's game over! Try again to beat your highest score.
The Simon Game is an excellent way to have fun while sharpening your memory skills. Challenge yourself or compete with friends to see who can remember the longest sequence!
